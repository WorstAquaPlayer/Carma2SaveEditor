# Carma2SaveEditor
This repository contains the [documentation](https://github.com/WorstAquaPlayer/Carma2SaveEditor/blob/master/SavedgamesDoc.md) and a tool to edit the save file of the game Carmageddon II: Carpocalypse Now.

- This tool was made using [Yarhl](https://github.com/SceneGate/Yarhl) and [Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia).
- The layout of the tool is heavily based on the layout of [Carmeditor 2](https://www.cwaboard.co.uk/viewtopic.php?t=9216), made by Shutting Down and Toshiba-3.

## Important things
- This tool was designed to use with the vanilla game, if the tool doesn't work as it should check your Carmageddon II instalation. 
- This tool requires you to select your Carmageddon II folder since it needs to load **RACES.TXT** and **OPPONENT.TXT** to read their data and display it, and to execute **CARMA2.EXE** from that folder with the *Start Game* button.
